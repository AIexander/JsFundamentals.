#### JavaScript

We've put together a condensed version of the fundamentals. They have been curated in a way that gives you enough information to figure out the exercises for that section.

You should read each tutorial and complete the corresponding exercises for each, with the exception of the JavaScript Overview and Code Organization chapters.

For example, I would read the Datatypes and Variables section and then complete the exercises found in variables.js.
